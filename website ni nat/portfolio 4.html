<h3>✎ Types of Computer</h3><br>

<h4>1. Supercomputers</h4>
<p>- As the name suggests, “super” means powerful. A supercomputer is the fastest and most powerful type of computer in the world. It can perform millions or even trillions of calculations in just one second (Sharma, 2025).
- They get their processing power by taking advantage of parallel processing; they use lots of CPUs at the same time on one problem. 
- According to Becher (2024), the distinguishing features of supercomputers are:
    <li>Fastest computers in the world</li>
    <li>Massive in size</li>
    <li>Computes one quintillion calculations per second</li>
    <li>Multiple CPUs</li>
    <li>Uses parallel processing</li>
    <li>Used for advanced simulations and data analysis</li>
</p>

<div class="image-container4">

<hr><br>

<h4>2. Mainframes</h4>
<p>- A mainframe is a high-performance computing system designed to rapidly process large amounts of data in bulk and host hundreds of thousands of end users at one time. They’re built with specialized hardware and redundant components, making them the most secure, reliable computers (Sharma, 2025).
- These computers are powerful enough to manage such heavy traffic, which is why big companies and government offices rely on them.
- These are computers that are similar to supercomputers in many aspects, the main difference between them is the fact that a supercomputer uses all its raw power to focus on very few tasks, while the purpose of a mainframe is to perform thousands or millions of operations concurrently.
- The meaning of the word “mainframe” originates from the term “main frame”, referring to the large cabinet that enclosed the central processing unit and main memory of early computers.
- According to Becher (2024), the distinguishing features of mainframes are:
    <li>Most reliable, secure computers</li>
    <li>Can support hundreds of thousands of users at a time</li>
    <li>Solves more than one million calculations per second</li>
    <li>Built to last</li>
    <li>Used for mission-critical applications</li>
</p>

<div class="image-container4">
    <img src="images/mf.png" alt="Mainframe Computer">

<h4>3. Minicomputers (Mid-range Computers)</h4>
<p>- It is a medium-sized computer consisting of two or more processors and supports multiple tasks at the same time. These are computers that are smaller, less expensive, and less powerful than a mainframe or supercomputer, but more expensive and more powerful than a personal computer. (Sharma, 2025).
- Minicomputers are used for scientific and engineering computations, business-transaction processing, file handling, and database management, and are often now referred to as small or midsize servers.
- According to Becher (2024), the distinguishing features of minicomputers are:
    <li>Multiple processors</li>
    <li>Can support multiple users</li>
    <li>Programmed for a specific application</li>
    <li>Used for industrial control systems, business transaction processing and database management</li>
</p>

<div class="image-container4">
    <img src="images/mn.png" alt="Minicomputer">
    <p class="img-caption4">Figure 5. Mid-Range Computer</p>
</div>

<h4>✎ Top three mid-range computer manufacturers:</h4><br>

<p>1. IBM leads with its robust and scalable computing solutions, particularly its mid-range Power Systems and mainframe servers, widely deployed in enterprise environments.
2. HP (Hewlett-Packard Enterprise) is a key competitor offering mid-range servers and computing solutions aimed at businesses of all sizes, known for its ProLiant servers and NonStop systems.
3. Sun Microsystems' SPARC systems were historically famous for their RISC-based architecture and high-performance servers, widely used in research and technical computing until Sun was acquired by Oracle.
</p><br>

<hr><br>

<h4>4. Microcomputers (Personal Computers)</h4>
<p>- These are general-purpose microcomputers made for individual use. These setups typically feature one microprocessor as their Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, storage and peripheral devices like a keyboard, mouse and monitor (Sharma, 2025).
- These computers include a microprocessor, memory and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single Printed Circuit Board (PCB).
- They became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors, but today, these computers are simply called Personal Computers (PC).
- According to Becher (2024), the distinguishing features of microcomputers are:
    <li>General-purpose computers</li>
    <li>Designed for convenience and affordability</li>
    <li>Single user</li>
    <li>Versatile models, from desktops to smartphones</li>
    <li>Used for web browsing, multimedia streaming and gaming</li>

    <li>Handheld Computer</li>
    <li>Wearable</li>
</p><br>

<hr><br>

<h4>5. Server Computers</h4>
<p>- It is a special type of computer that is used to store, manage and share data and program with other computers (called clients) over a network. Instead of solving big, complex problems like a supercomputer, a server handles many small and similar requests from multiple users at the same time (Sharma, 2025).
- It refers to a central computer that contains collections of data and programs.
- Also called a network server, this system allows all connected users to share and store electronic data and applications. Two important types of servers are file servers and application servers.
- It may serve data to systems on a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN) over the Internet.
- Wikipedia can be a good example for a server computer. Let’s understand it. When someone searches for a page, the server finds that page and sends it back to the user’s device (Types of Computers, 2019). </p>

<h4>6. Workstations</h4>
<p>- Workstations are intended for professional use, and are often connected to two or more display monitors. They can only manage one user at a time, and have become less distinguishable from high-end personal computers as the latter becomes more capable (Sharma, 2025).
- The term workstation may also refer to “dumb” terminals that are connected to a mainframe computer.
- These are high-performance computers that are basically designed for a single user and have advanced graphics capabilities, large storage capacity, and a powerful Central Processing Unit (CPU).
- Some of the complex procedures consist of science, math and engineering calculations and are useful for computer design and manufacturing.
- Apple's Mac Pro would be considered a workstation.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Topic 2: Software and Its Types</h3><br>

<h4>✎ What is Software?</h4>
<p>Software is a program that enables a computer to perform a specific task, as opposed to the physical components of the system (hardware).  This includes application software such as a word processor, which enables a user to perform a task, and system software such as an operating system, which enables other software to run properly, by interfacing with hardware and with other software (Wang, 2020).
</p><br>

<div class="image-container4">
    <img src="images/swhei.png" alt="Software Hierarchy">
    <p class="img-caption4">Figure 10. Software Hierarchy</p>
</div>

<h3>✎ Types of Software</h3><br>

<h4>1. Application Software</h4>
<p>- Application software (App) is a kind of software that performs specific functions for the end user by interacting directly with it. The sole purpose of application software is to aid the user in doing specified tasks (Simplilearn, 2022).
- Are programs that are of actual value to the user. From the word “application”, these kind of software simply “apply” (make use) of the capabilities of the computer (such as high speed calculations, accuracy given the right algorithm, etc) to solve anything from simple daily tasks (such as e-mail, word-processing, etc) to complex special purpose computing (managing the power grid, controlling a nuclear reactor, managing a police database).
- These can be further classified into two:
</p><br>

<h5>General-Purpose Application Software</h5>
<p>- Are software that execute common information processing tasks for the end user, such as word processing, presentation management, web browsing, and so on. They are referred to as general purpose apps because the end user is primarily responsible for determining how to use them. They are versatile and can be utilized for a variety of reasons (Two Main Types of Application Software Explained, 2024).
- Software Suites - A collection of functionally related software, often sharing similar GUI, bundled together. Saves both money and effort that could have been spent by purchasing individual software. Examples of productivity suites include; Microsoft Office Suite, Libre Office Suite, iWork Office Suite, Adobe Creating Suite</p>

<div class="image-container4">
    <img src="images/suites.png" alt="Software Suites">
    <p class="img-caption4">Figure 11. Popular Software Suites</p>
</div>

<h5>Application Specific Software</h5>
<p>- Are software that are intended to carry out a specific task. ERP, CRM, and SCM are some examples of business software applications. These types of software tend to be more inflexible in purpose, yet function more effectively for the reasons they were designed for (Two Main Types of Application Software Explained, 2024).
- Application-specific software packages are customized to meet the needs of particular applications, such as eddy-covariance systems, flood-warning systems, and automated weather stations.
</p><br>

<hr><br>

<h4>2. System Software</h4>
<p>- System software is a program that is designed to execute and process hardware and application software development simultaneously. Therefore, we can say that it is an interface between hardware and application software. It is used to manage and run mobile and computer systems. It runs in the background and maintains the essential functions of the device (Halwai, 2021).
- Due to system software, higher-level application software can perform their tasks efficiently. As system software runs at the primary level in your computer and mobile, it is called low-level software. It provides a platform for application software to run on the top and interact with users.
- These can be further classified into two:
</p><br>

<h5>System Management Software</h5>
<p>- Are basically software that run, manage, and/or support computer hardware, networking, application software execution, and data resources. Examples include operating systems, network management programs, DBMS, and system utilities.
</p>

<div class="image-container4">
    <img src="images/os.png" alt="Device Drivers">
    <p class="img-caption4">Figure 12. Operating Systems Examples</p>
</div>

<p>- Device Drivers- are a class of system software that minimizes the need for system troubleshooting. Device drivers make it simple to manage and regulate this communication. A driver typically communicates with the device through the computer bus or communications subsystem to which the hardware connects. Most popular forms of drivers are motherboard, graphics card, and printer drivers</p>

<div class="image-container4">
    <img src="images/devicedrivers.png" alt="Device Drivers">
    <p class="img-caption4">Figure 13. Device Drivers</p>
</div>

<h5>System Development Software</h5>
<p>System development is the process of defining, designing, testing, and deploying a new software application or program. It may include the internal development of personalized systems, the establishment of database systems, or the purchasing of third-party software.  System developers utilize tools or computer programs to design, debug, maintain, or support other programs and applications.

- Purpose: Enhances learning through digital resources, facilitates virtual classrooms, supports administrative data management, and enables communication through email and collaboration platforms.</p>
<br>
<h4>✎ Business and Enterprise Management</h4>
<p>- Businesses and financial institutions are major users of both hardware and software to manage operations, customer relations, and financial transactions (View of the Application of Computer Hardware and Software in Enterprise Management, 2025).

- Hardware types: Workstations, servers, Point of Sale (POS) systems, biometric devices
- Software types: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), accounting and finance software, security and encryption tools
- Purpose: Enhances operational efficiency, supports decision-making, secures transactions, and improves customer service.</p>
<br>
<h4>✎ Government Institutions</h4>
<p>- Government agencies implement computer systems to provide services efficiently and maintain administrative control. Both hardware and software employed are often robust, scalable, and secure to handle sensitive data.

- Hardware types: Servers, networking gear, desktop computers, kiosks for public service
- Software types: Government management software (financial, personnel, case management), database management systems, security software
- Purpose: Facilitates data processing, public administration, delivery of citizen services (e.g., tax filing, licensing), and ensures data security and transparency.</p>

<h3>Reaction / Analysis</h3><br>

<p>Computer hardware refers to all the physical components, internal or external, that we can touch. Personally, I think the hardware of the computer is what makes human-computer interaction possible—it is what connects both software and the users. As I delved deeper, I discovered how computers are categorized based on their size and specific purposes. Learning about the different types of computers—from supercomputers that can perform trillions of calculations per second, to personal microcomputers designed for everyday use—showed me how versatile and powerful computing has become. It also made me realize how different computing needs require different kinds of hardware setups.</p>
<br>
<p>Exploring software clarified the important role it plays in directing the hardware to perform specific tasks. The division between system software, which manages hardware and provides a platform for everything else, and application software, which allows users to do tasks like word processing or browsing the web, made a lot of sense. When I read about how system software includes operating systems and drivers working behind the scenes, I understood why most users are not aware of it but benefit from it continuously. Application software, on the other hand, is what users directly interact with, making it the visible side of computing.
</p><br>

<p>What I found particularly useful was learning how different institutions implement computer hardware and software according to their needs. I realized how very relevant and frequent we implement hardware and software in our everyday lives, it’s just that we got used to it and it became a normality for us that we sometimes tend to overlook how incorporating them in different institutions greatly helped improve the state of our society. For example, schools use computers and learning software to improve education and administration, hospitals rely on advanced computer systems for patient care and diagnostics, and businesses depend on hardware and software to manage operations and customer relations. This showed me that the impact of computer technology goes far beyond personal use—it plays a vital role in society by improving efficiency, services, and connectivity.
</p><br>

<p>Overall, computers serve as a combination of sophisticated physical components and layered software systems working together. It also made me appreciate the targeted application of technology in various sectors to solve real problems and enhance human capabilities.
