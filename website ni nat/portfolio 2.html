<h3>DATA AND INFORMATION</h3><br>

<h4>✎ What is DATA?</h4>
<p>- A collection of raw facts and figures (Actian Corporation, 2023).
- Data can take many different forms, such as text, images, videos, or numerical values. It serves as the raw material for analysis, processing, and communication processes, enabling software and systems to make decisions, generate reports, and provide a wide range of functions in the digital world.
</p><br>

<h4>✎ What is INFORMATION?</h4>
<p>- Is data that has been processed and contextualized for a user (Actian Corporation, 2023).
- Information encompasses elements such as facts, figures, texts, or media, which are used to make decisions, generate knowledge, or facilitate processes.

    <p class="img-caption2">Figure 2. Data and Information Comparison</p>
</div>
<br>

<h4>✎ What are the Differences Between Data and Information?</h4>
<p>The main difference is that data are objective representations of facts or observations, but they have no meaning of their own. For example, the binary sequence “01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111” is meaningless data until it is interpreted.
</p><br>
<p>Information, on the other hand, is the result of processing data through algorithms, analysis, and interpretation. Thus, once interpreted, the binary sequence referred to above is revealed as the ASCII code for the word “Hello”. The raw data then becomes comprehensible and intelligible information.</p><br>

<h3>INFORMATION SYSTEMS</h3><br>

<h4>✎ What is Information Systems?</h4>
<p>- Is “any organized combination of people, hardware, software, communications networks, data resources, and policies and procedures that stores, retrieves, transforms, and disseminates information in an organization” (Pantea Keikhosrokiani, 2019).
- An academic study of systems with a specific reference to information and the complementary networks of hardware and software that people and organizations use to collect, filter, process, create and also distribute data.
- IS is not the same as information technology but a system in which information technology plays an important role.
- Information systems (IS) is an integrated environment of the hardware, software, peoples which mainly functions for the purpose of collecting and processing data to valuable information by applying a list of procedures on data  collection, thus information is derived from data by IS procedures.</p><br>

<h3>Different Types of Support Systems in Information Systems</h3><br>
<p>The common classification of the information systems based on the use of such systems can be in the fourth levels starting from the top level at executive information systems, the middle level that deals with decision support systems and management information systems to the low level that is concerned with transaction processing systems as shown in the figure.</p><br>

</div>

<h4>✎ Executive Information Systems (EIS)</h4>
<p>- EIS is a system located at the top level of the administration pyramid, it supports the strategic information needs of top executives, providing the information needed to handle executive functions, such as developing an organization’s strategic goals and objectives and plans for achieving them. This includes providing the information needed for managers to understand and manage their organization’s supply chain and value chain, which can be helpful to streamline production processes and provide better customer service (Mahesh, 2024).
- According to Forat & Hasan (2018), here are the outlines of EIS:
        <li> Provides a suitable environment to easily access the internal and external information. </li>
        <li> Provides easy access to data warehousing systems that contain the past and latest data. </li>
        <li> Concerned with high level management. </li>
        <li> Uses data mining techniques for the purpose of aggregate, analysis data and predicting the future. </li>
        <li> Provides a better view using both graphics and text tools for the purpose of reporting the situations and explaining the status.</li>
- Examples:
        <li> Executive Dashboards for KPIs</li>
        <li> Strategic Performance Management Systems</li>
        <li> Corporate Scorecard Systems</li>
</p><br>


<h4>✎ Decision Support Systems (DSS)</h4>
<p>- DSS assists in decision-making by providing interactive tools and access to data analysis. Typically, senior managers use a DSS to obtain tactical information that helps them make routine, short-term decisions about an organization’s operations. This helps ensure that organizations stay on track to achieve long-term goals and objectives. Interactive tools available through a DSS enhance these efforts by providing information and technology needed for activities such as project management and employee training (Mahesh, 2024).
- According to Forat & Hasan (2018), here are the outlines of DSS:
        <li>Helps in future predicting.</li>
        <li>Supports decisions in each phase of the decision process.</li>
        <li>Helps to determine and solve problems.</li>
- Examples:
        <li>Supply Chain Analytics Systems</li>
        <li>Financial Planning Systems</li>
        <li>Sales Forecasting Systems</li>
        <li>Risk Analysis Software</li>
        <li>Clinical Decision Support Systems</li>
-The decision making process can be separated into four stages as shown:

</div><br>

<h4>✎ Management Information Systems (MIS)</h4>
<p>- MIS provides middle managers with reports and summaries to support decision-making and managerial functions. For example, middle managers may use an MIS to generate reports, such as budgeting documents and cash flow statements, to understand an organization’s financial status. Hence, MIS is defined as a system that provides the information for decision making by using organization databases (Mahesh, 2024).
- According to Forat & Hasan (2018), here are the outlines of MIS:
        <li>Makes information available for all the levels in the organization. </li>
        <li>Provides information for decision making. </li>
        <li>Helps to analyze and solve problems. </li>
        <li>MIS plays an important role in the organization by the functions and procedures that are performed at the entire levels in the organization. </li>
        <li>Helps in setting planning policies for the organization.</li>
- Examples:
        <li>Human Resource Information System (HRIS)</li>
        <li>Inventory Management Systems</li>
        <li>Payroll Systems</li>
        <li>Sales Management Systems</li>
        <li>Financial Reporting Systems</li>
</p><br>


<h4>✎ Transaction Processing Systems (TPS)</h4>
<p>- TPS handles day-to-day transactions, such as order processing and payroll. For frontline staff, a TPS provides information necessary to handle an organization’s daily operations, such as inventory reports and customer service records (Mahesh, 2024).
- According to Forat & Hasan (2018), here are the outlines of TPS:
        <li>Supports all the systems organization by the information.</li>
        <li>Collets the data from the internal and external sources.</li>
        <li>Used by operational personnel and supervisory levels.</li>
- Examples:
        <li>Banking ATMs</li>
        <li>Stock Exchanges (e.g., New York Stock Exchange)</li>
        <li>irline Reservation Systems</li>
        <li>Point of Sale (POS) Systems in retail</li>
        <li>E-commerce platforms like Amazon, eBay</li>
        <li>Healthcare management systems</li>
</p><br>

<h3>ANALYSIS / REACTION</h3><br>

<p>Data and information form the backbone of any computing and organizational environment. Without context, the terms data and information are often used as if they were synonyms. However, it’s very evident how this is incorrect. In fact, these two notions are very different from each other. Through my research about it, I gained clarity on how raw data which might be meaningless by itself, transforms into valuable information when processed and contextualized through information systems. This transformation is crucial as it turns facts and figures into meaningful insights that drive actions and decisions. 
</p><br>
<p>From what I have gathered, information systems is a set of interconnected components that perform the collection, processing, storage, and distribution of data, information, and digital products in order to support decision-making in an organization. These systems play an important role in managing and facilitating various business processes and can also be used in individuals’ personal lives. Like when organizations have robust information systems, they are more capable of planning strategically to gain a competitive edge and achieve success.</p><br>
<p>As I delve further into the topics, I recalled the diverse types of information systems initially discussed to us in class. These types of information systems have varied functions, reflecting the different organizational needs and management levels. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) handle routine, day-to-day transactions of employees in an organization like sales or payroll. Management Information Systems (MIS) manage, compile, and summarize data from operational systems to generate reports for middle management's routine decision-making. Decision Support Systems (DSS) assist in tackling complex problems by analyzing data and generating possible solutions for the managers and analysts. Executive Information Systems (EIS) provide the higher-ups of the organization like the senior executives with synthesized, real-time information to monitor organizational performance and inform strategic decisions. </p><br>
<p>These different types of support systems in information systems play a crucial role in their respective fields to help improve the state of an organization. This leads me to think how significant the relevance of information systems is to business or any organization. Not only does it improve the productivity of an organization, but it also helps in decision making which essentially improves the overall trajectory of the organization.</p><br>
