<h3 style="text-align: center;">Introduction: The Motherboard</h3>

<h4>✒ What is a Motherboard?</h4><br>
<p>- A motherboard is a type of computer hardware that serves as the main circuit board in a computer system. It is also known as the mainboard, system board, or logic board. The motherboard acts as a central hub, connecting and providing support for various components and peripherals within the computer (Motherboard: Definition, Types and Components, 2024).
- It is also called the system board because it is the main circuit board of the system unit and it has many electronic components attached to it and others are built into it.
- The design and layout of a motherboard can vary depending on the specific computer system and its intended use. Different motherboards may have different sizes, form factors, and socket types to accommodate various processors and expansion slots for additional components.</p>
<br><br>
<p> The motherboard plays an essential role in determining system compatibility, performance, and expandability in a computer. It acts as the central hub for connecting the CPU, memory, storage devices, and peripherals, which means compatibility is crucial (Romero, 2020). The CPU socket and chipset determine which processors and components can be used, and while the number and kind of RAM slots dictate memory capacity and speed support. Expansion slots, such as PCIe, affect future hardware upgrades, while built-in features like USB ports and networking improve efficiency. A well-chosen motherboard ensures that all components operate together seamlessly, optimizing performance and stability for a variety of computing requirements.</p><br>
<p> The goal of this comparative study is to provide a thorough comparison of various motherboard models by analyzing major characteristics and form aspects. The study's goal is to determine which motherboard designs are most suited for specific applications by investigating changes in size, build, slot layout, chipsets, BIOS, connectivity options, and integrated features. Understanding these differences enables users to choose the most compatible and effective motherboard for their specific requirements, while balancing performance, expandability, and price.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Discussion: Basic Parts of a Motherboard</h3>
<br>
<h4>✒ CPU Socket/Slots</h4>
<p> The CPU socket is a specialized slot on the motherboard where the processor is installed. It ensures the CPU is securely connected both physically and electrically to communicate with other components. Compatibility between the CPU and socket type is crucial, as different processors require specific socket designs, such as Intel’s LGA or AMD’s PGA sockets. Proper installation is delicate and requires alignment with notches or triangular markers on both the CPU and socket to avoid damage (Cooper, 2025)</p>
<br>
<h4>✒ Memory Slots</h4>
<p>These slots, typically DIMM (Dual Inline Memory Module) slots, hold RAM modules and determine the type and amount of memory the system supports. More slots mean more memory capacity and potential for higher system performance. The motherboard chipset controls which memory types (e.g., DDR4, DDR5) are compatible</p>
<br>
<h4>✒ Chipset</h4>
<p>The chipset acts as a communication controller between the CPU, memory, storage, and peripherals. It governs data flow across the motherboard, defining supported hardware, I/O capabilities, and system features. Modern motherboards integrate northbridge and southbridge functionality into a unified chipset</p>
<br>
<h4>✒ BIOS/UEFI</h4>
<p>The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or its modern version, UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), is firmware embedded on the motherboard. It initializes hardware at startup, performs POST (Power-On Self-Test), and hands control to the operating system bootloader. UEFI offers advanced features like graphical interfaces and secure boot.
</p><br>

<h4>✒ Expansion Slots (PCI, PCIe)</h4>
<p>These slots allow user to add components like graphics cards, sound cards network adapters, and more. PCIe (PCI Express) is the current standard offering faster data transfer rate and better scalability, while the older PCI standard still appears on some boards for legacy devices.</p><br>

<h4>✒ SATA Ports</h4>
<p>Serial ATA (SATA) ports connect internal storage devices such as hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs). The number of SATA ports limits how many storage drives can be connected directly to the motherboard</p><br>

<h4>✒ Built-in Features</h4>
<p>Modern motherboards often include integrated components like audio chips, Ethernet networking controllers, USB ports, and sometimes Wi-Fi modules. These built-in features provide essential functionality without needing expansion cards</p><br>

<hr><br>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Types of Motherboards</h3><br>

<h4>✒ AT Motherboard</h4>
<p>One of the earliest designs with larger size and basic features, largely obsolete today.</p>
<br>
<h4>✒ ATX Motherboard</h4>
<p>The most common modern standard with versatile features and expandability.</p>
<br>
<h4>✒ BTX Motherboard</h4>
<p>Designed for better airflow and thermal management, less common than ATX.</p>
<br>
<h4>✒ Extended-ATX (E-ATX)</h4>
<p>Larger than standard ATX, ideal for high-end and workstation builds with extra slots.</p>
<br>
<h4>✒ LPX Motherboard</h4>
<p>Older low-profile design with riser cards, mostly replaced by newer standards.</p>
<br>
<h4>✒ Micro-ATX Motherboard</h4>
<p> A smaller, budget-friendly variant of ATX with fewer expansion slots</p><br> 

<h4>✒ Mini ITX Motherboard</h4>
<p>Compact size designed for small form factor PCs with limited expandability</p><br> 

<h4>✒ Mini-ATX Motherboard</h4>
<p>Smaller than ATX but larger than Mini ITX, balancing size and features.</p><br> 

<h4>✒ Pico BTX Motherboard</h4>
<p>Very small form factor variant of BTX, rarely used</p><br> 

<h4>✒ Standard-ATX Motherboard</h4>
<p>The original ATX size specification, widely used and still relevant.</p><br>
