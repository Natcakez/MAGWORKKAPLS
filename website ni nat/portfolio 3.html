<h3 style="text-align: center;">Topic 1: What Are Number Systems?</h3><br>

<p>➺ A number system is defined as a system of writing to express numbers. It is the mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set by using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner (Number System in Maths- Definition, Types & Conversion, n.d.).
➺ It provides a unique representation of every number and represents the arithmetic and algebraic structure of the figures. It also allows us to operate arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
➺ They enable counting, measuring, and performing arithmetic operations consistently. These systems are fundamental to mathematics and crucial for fields like computer science, engineering, and daily life applications.
➺ The value of any digit in a number can be determined by:
        <li>The digit;</li>
        <li>Its position in the number;</li>
        <li>The base of the number system;</li>
➺ In the context of computers, a number system represents data and performs operations at the machine level. Computers typically work with binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal systems. These systems serve as the foundation for data encoding, arithmetic operations, and other computations in computers (Number System in Computer Organization: Its Types & Examples, 2024).

<h3>✦ Types of Numbers</h3><br>

<h4>1. Natural Numbers</h4>
<p>- Natural numbers are positive whole numbers starting from 1 and going on forever. They are used for counting things. Natural numbers do not include 0, fractions, decimals, or negative numbers (School, 2024).
- The set of natural numbers is usually represented by the letter ” N”
- N = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 . . . .}
- Natural numbers are all numbers starting from 1 and going up, but they do not include 0. This means every natural number is a whole number, but not every whole number is a natural number.
</p><br>

<h4>2. Whole Numbers</h4>
<p>- Whole numbers are non-negative integers that do not have any fractions or decimals (School, 2024). 
- They are represented by the letter “W,” and the set of whole numbers is W = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …}.
</p><br>

<h4>3. Real Numbers</h4>
<p>- Real numbers include all positive and negative whole numbers, as well as fractions and decimals, but they do not include imaginary numbers (School, 2024). 
- They are represented by the symbol “R.”
</p><br>

<h4>4. Integers</h4>
<p>- Integers are a group of numbers that include natural numbers, their negative counterparts, and zero. This means they cover all positive numbers, negative numbers, and 0. Integers cannot be fractions or decimals. Natural numbers are integers that begin at 1 and go on forever. Whole numbers are integers that start at 0 and also continue to infinity (School, 2024).
- The set of integers is usually represented by the letter “Z”. It can also be represented by the letter “J”
- Z = { . . . -3,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 . . . }
</p><br>

<h4>5. Rational Numbers</h4>
<p>- Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of two whole numbers. For example, the fractions 13 and -11118 are rational numbers. All whole numbers are also rational because they can be written as a fraction with a denominator of 1 (School, 2024).
- Any decimal that ends is a rational number, like 8.27, which can be written as 827/100. Decimals that repeat a pattern after a certain point are also considered rational numbers.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Topic 2: Types of Number Systems</h3><br>

<p>There are various types of number systems in mathematics. The four most common number system types are:

➙ Decimal number system (Base- 10)
➙ Binary number system (Base- 2)
➙ Octal number system (Base-8)
➙ Hexadecimal number system (Base- 16)
</p>

    <img src="images/numsys.png" alt="4 Number Systems Overview">
    <p class="img-caption3">Figure 3. Four Major Number Systems</p>
</div>

<h4>✦ Decimal Number System (Base 10)</h4>
<p>- The decimal number system is used in everyday life, based on base 10. It uses digits from 0 to 9. Although computers don't natively use the decimal system, it is important for human-computer interaction, as users generally interact with computers using decimal numbers (Number System in Computer Organization: Its Types & Examples, 2024).
- In the decimal number system, the positions successive to the left of the decimal point represent units, tens, hundreds, thousands and so on. This system is expressed in decimal numbers. Every position shows a particular power of the base (10).
</p>

<div class="image-container3">
    <img src="images/dec1.png" alt="Decimal System Example">
    <p class="img-caption3">Figure 4. Decimal Number Structure</p>
</div>

<p>- Example of Decimal Number System:
The decimal number 1457 consists of the digit 7 in the units position, 5 in the tens place, 4 in the hundreds position, and 1 in the thousands place whose value can be written as:

    <p class="img-caption3">Figure 5. Decimal Number Example</p>
</div>

<h4>✦ Binary Number System (Base 2)</h4>
<p>- The binary number system is the most fundamental system used in computers. It uses only two digits, 0 and 1, to represent all data. This is because the underlying electronic circuits in a computer can only understand two states on (1) and off (0) (Number System in Computer Organization: Its Types & Examples, 2024).
- We can convert any system into binary and vice versa.
</p>

<div class="image-container3">
    <img src="images/bi1.png" alt="Binary Numbers">
    <p class="img-caption3">Figure 6. Binary Number Representation</p>
</div>

<p>- Every bit in binary can represent a single binary digit, making it the building block for all computer operations. Specifically, the usual base-2 is a radix of 2. The figures described under this system are known as binary numbers which are the combination of 0 and 1. For example, 110101 is a binary number.</p>

<div class="image-container3">
    <img src="images/bi2.png" alt="Binary Numbers">
    <p class="img-caption3">Figure 7. Binary Number Example</p>
</div>

<h4>✦ Octal Number System (Base 8)</h4>
<p>- The octal number system is a base-8 system that uses digits from 0 to 7. It is used as a shorthand representation of binary numbers because each octal digit corresponds to a group of three binary digits (bits) (Number System in Computer Organization: Its Types & Examples, 2024).
- Octal numbers are commonly used in computer applications. Converting an octal number to decimal is the same as decimal conversion and is explained below using an example.

    <img src="images/oct2.png" alt="Octal Numbers">
    <p class="img-caption3">Figure 9. Octal Number Example</p>
</div>

<h4>✦ Hexadecimal Number System (Base 16)</h4>
<p>- The hexadecimal number system is a base-16 system which is commonly used in computer programming to represent binary data, as each hexadecimal digit corresponds to four binary digits (Number System in Computer Organization: Its Types & Examples, 2024).
 - In the hexadecimal system, the numbers are first represented just like in the decimal system, i.e. from 0 to 9. Then, the numbers are represented using the alphabet from A to F. The below-given table shows the representation of numbers in the hexadecimal number system.

</div>

<h4>Other Number Systems</h4><br>

<h4>✦ ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)</h4>
<p>- ASCII is a 7-bit character set encoding standard for representing English letters, numbers, and symbols within computers with numeric values. ASCII converts characters into binary codes for storage and processing.

Example: 'A' = 65 → Binary: 01000001</p><br>

<h4>✦ Unicode</h4>
<p>Unicode is a platform-independent character encoding scheme that can be utilized to represent text in any language and script. It gives a code point to every character, which makes the data represent uniformly on any platform.

Example: 'अ' = U+0905 → Binary (UTF-16): 0000100100000101
</p><br>

<h4>✦ ISCII (Indian Script Code for Information Interchange)</h4>
<p>ISCII is an 8-bit encoding scheme developed to represent Indian scripts such as Devanagari or Tamil or Bengali. All Indian language characters are encoded together in one binary format that is common to all. 

Example: 'अ' = Code 161 → Binary: 10100001

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Topic 3: Uses and Significance of Each Number System</h3>

<h4>✦ Decimal System</h4>
<p>- The decimal system is the most widely used number system by humans for everyday counting, commerce, measurements, and scientific calculations.
- Its significance lies in its compatibility with human perception as we generally count using ten fingers. 
- It facilitates precise representation of quantities including fractions through decimal notation. It is extensively applied in banking, finance, cooking, medicine, engineering, navigation, and data analysis due to its intuitive use and ease of arithmetic operations (Admin, 2018).
</p><br>

<h4>✦ Binary System</h4>
<p>- Its significance mostly lies in its simplicity for representing two-state systems (on/off, true/false) in circuit design and data encoding. Binary enables efficient processing, storage, and communication of digital information in all modern technology from processors to communication systems.</p><br>

<h4>✦ Octal System</h4>
<p>- Octal provides a compact form of representing binary numbers, grouping them into sets of three bits. It was traditionally significant in early computing systems for simplifying binary data representation and minimizing errors. Though less prevalent today, it remains useful in digital electronics and low-level programming contexts (kyazawa01, 2025).</p><br>

<h4>✦ Hexadecimal System</h4>
<p>- Hexadecimal is widely used in computing as a condensed representation of binary data, grouping bits in sets of four. 
- It is essential in programming, memory addressing, color coding in graphics, and digital system design. Hexadecimal simplifies reading and writing binary-coded values and improves clarity in debugging and system analysis.

<h3>Reaction / Analysis</h3><br>

<p>As I research about the number systems, their types, and the uses or significance of each, I was enlightened into how humans have devised various methods to represent and manipulate numbers throughout history and modern times. The concept of a number system itself is foundational in mathematics and everyday life, serving as the language through which quantities are expressed and understood.</p><br>
<p>The decimal system, clearly the most intuitive and widely used, reflects our natural inclination to count in tens, likely influenced by the number of fingers we have. Its widespread use in commerce, education, science, and daily activities emphasizes the significance of a system that can accurately represent not only whole numbers but also fractions and decimals. Recognizing the importance of the decimal number system increases appreciation for its simplicity and efficiency, which remain unparalleled in most real-world applications outside of computing.</p><br>
<p>On the other hand, the binary, octal, and hexadecimal number systems reveal the fascinating intersection between theoretical mathematics and practical technology. The binary number system, with its base-2 representation of data using only two digits (0 and 1), underlies all digital computing. This dualistic representation aligns perfectly with the on/off states of electronic circuits, enabling the powerful computational abilities modern society depends on. The octal and hexadecimal systems serve as convenient shorthand notations for binary data, reducing complexity and improving readability especially in programming, system design, and digital communications. Learning how these systems complement each other highlights the sophistication behind what might seem like abstract numerical representations.</p><br>
<p>Exploring these systems collectively, I realized how math, technology, and human cognition intertwine in the evolution and application of number systems. Each system fits a specific role, decimal for humans, binary for machines, and octal/hexadecimal as bridges between the two. This insight is profound because it links simple mathematical concepts to complex technological realities, enhancing my understanding of computer science fundamentals as well as the history of mathematics.</p><br>
