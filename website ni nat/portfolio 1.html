    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Topic #1: Computer Science as a Discipline</h3>
<br>
    <h4>Definition:</h4>
    <p>- Denning et al. (1989) described Computer Science as “the systematic study of algorithmic processes that describe and transform information: their theory, analysis, design, efficiency, implementation, and application” (p. 2).
- It combines both theoretical and practical aspects, including the design and analysis of algorithms, computational theory, hardware and software development, and problem-solving across various domains. 
- The discipline is interdisciplinary, drawing from mathematics, engineering, physics, and logic, and involves the study of algorithmic processes, computational machines, and the transformation of information.
</p><br>
    <h4>History:</h4>
    <p>- The discipline of computer science was born in the early 1940s through the merging of algorithm theory, mathematical logic, and the advent of the stored-program electronic computer (Denning et al., 1989).
- Computer science originated from attempts to formalize mathematics and computation through abstract, formal systems. The goal was to establish foundational rules and symbols that could be manipulated consistently to solve problems and reason logically.
- The discipline has roots in mathematics and physics, developing from 19th-century mechanical calculators created to address complex computational challenges (Davies, 2022).</p>

    </div>

    <h4>Timeline of Key Contributions</h4>
    <p>According to Williamson (2023), the origins of computers date back more than two centuries. Initially conceptualized by mathematicians and entrepreneurs, the 19th century saw the creation of mechanical calculating machines designed to address increasingly complex numerical problems. Advances in technology during the early 20th century led to the development of larger and more powerful computers.
    </p><br>
    <ul>
        <b>★ 1801: Joseph Marie Jacquard</b><br>
        <p>- A French merchant and inventor invents a loom that uses punched wooden cards to automatically weave fabric designs. 
- This idea of using punched cards as input was later adapted by early computers for data input and control.
</p><br>
        <b>★ 1821: Charles Babbage</b><br>
        <p>- An English mathematician who conceived the “Difference Engine”, a steam-driven calculating machine designed to compute numerical tables automatically. Despite British government funding, the project failed due to technological limitations at the time, including difficulties in precise manufacturing and financial and contractual disputes.</p><br>
        <b>★ 1848: Ada Lovelace</b><br>
        <p>- An English mathematician and the daughter of poet Lord Byron.
- Lovelace wrote what is considered the first computer program, in the form of a step-by-step method to compute Bernoulli numbers using Babbage's Analytical Engine. 
- Her extensive notes on a translation of a paper about the engine described this algorithmic process, making her the world's first computer programmer.
</p><br>
        <b>★ 1890: Herman Hollerith</b><br>
        <p>- Developed a punch-card system to assist with the U.S. Census calculations, significantly reducing the time and cost required. 
- Hollerith later founded a company that evolved into International Business Machines Corporation (IBM).</p><br>
        <b>★ 1931: Vannevar Bush</b><br>
        <p>- At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Vannevar Bush invented the Differential Analyzer, the first large-scale automatic general-purpose mechanical analog computer. 
- It was a major advancement in automating complex mathematical operations through mechanical means.
</p><br>
        <b>★ 1931: Kurt Friedrich Goedel</b><br>
        <p>- He was a logician, mathematician, and philosopher. 
- According to Schmidhuber (2021), Gödel’s incompleteness theorems in the early 1930s laid fundamental limits on computation and formal systems, influencing theoretical computer science.
- He is known as the principal founder of the modern, metamathematical era in mathematical logic.
</p><br>
        <b>★ 1936: Alan Mathison Turing</b><br>
        <p>- A British scientist and mathematician who presented the principle of a universal machine, later called the Turing machine, in his paper called "On Computable Numbers". 
- This theoretical model could simulate any computational process, forming the conceptual foundation of modern computing.
- Turing is later involved in the development of the Turing-Welchman Bombe, an electro-mechanical device designed to decipher Nazi codes during World War II.
</p><br>
        <b>★ 1939-1941: John Vincent Atanasoff & Clifford Berry</b><br>
        <p>- John Vincent Atanasoff, a professor of physics and mathematics, proposed building the first fully electric computer, without using gears, cams, belts or shafts. 
- Atanasoff and his graduate student, Clifford Berry, design the first digital electronic computer in the U.S., called the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC). 
- This design marked a shift toward purely electronic computation. This also marks the first time a computer is able to store information on its main memory, and is capable of performing one operation every 15 seconds.
</p><br>
        <b>★ 1941: Konrad Zuse</b><br>
        <p>- German inventor and engineer who invented the Z3 machine, the world's first working programmable, fully automatic digital computer.
- According to Lasky (2024), the machine was destroyed during a bombing raid on Berlin during World War II. Post-war, Zuse fled Berlin and later completed the Z4, which is considered the world's first commercial digital computer.
- He has often been regarded as the inventor of the modern computer.</p><br>
        <b>★ 1944: Howard Hathaway Aiken</b><br>
        <p>- A  pioneering computer scientist best known for designing the Harvard Mark I, one of the earliest electromechanical computers built in the early 1940s. 
- The Mark I was capable of performing long computation processes automatically, marking a critical step in transitioning from manual calculation to automated computing.
- Aiken's work helped lay the foundation for programmable machines and influenced the design and development of subsequent computers. His emphasis on engineering large-scale calculating machines was a key contribution to the discipline's technological evolution.
</p><br>
        <b>★ 1945: John von Neumann</b><br>
        <p>- He was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, engineer, and polymath.
- He introduced the concept of the stored-program computer architecture (now called von Neumann architecture) in his 1945 report on the EDVAC. This architecture stores program instructions in the same memory as data, making computers more flexible and efficient.
- He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics in the development of functional analysis, and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata, the universal constructor and the digital computer.</p><br>
        <b>★ 1945-1946: John Mauchly  &  J. Presper Eckert</b><br>
        <p>- Two professors at the University of Pennsylvania, John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert designed and built the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC). 
- The machine was considered the first "automatic, general-purpose, electronic, decimal, digital computer,". 
- In 1946, Mauchly and Presper left the University of Pennsylvania and received funding from the Census Bureau to build the UNIVAC, the first commercial computer for business and government applications.
</p><br>
        <b>★ 1947: William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain</b><br>
        <p>- Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain of Bell Laboratories invented the transistor. 
- They discover how to make an electric switch with solid materials and without the need for a vacuum.
- This invention of the transistor sparked the development of smaller, more reliable computers.
</p><br>
        <b>★ 1953: Grace Hopper</b><br>
        <p>- Grace Hopper develops one of the first high-level programming languages, which eventually becomes known as COBOL, which stands for Common, Business-Oriented Language.
- Hopper is later dubbed the "First Lady of Software" in her posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom citation.
</p><br>
        <b>★ 1968 - Douglas Engelbart</b><br>
        <p>- Douglas Engelbart revealed a prototype of the modern computer at the Fall Joint Computer Conference, San Francisco. 
- According to Salamanca (n.d.), his presentation, called "A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect" included a live demonstration of his computer, including a mouse and a graphical user interface (GUI). 
- This marks the development of the computer from a specialized machine for academics to a technology that is more accessible to the general public.
</p><br>
        <b>★ 1969–72 - Dennis Ritchie</b><br>
        <p>- Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson, and a group of other developers at Bell Labs produce UNIX, an operating system that made "large-scale networking of diverse computing systems — and the internet — practical". 
- In 1972, Dennis Ritchie created the C programming language, which was designed to facilitate writing UNIX (Boslaugh, 2024). 
- Ken Thompson soon rewrote the UNIX kernel in C, which made the operating system portable across different hardware (Boslaugh, 2024).

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="images/discipline.png" alt="Computing Disciplines Diagram">
        <p class="img-caption">Figure 3. The Five Computing Disciplines</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Definition:</h4>
    <p>★ Computing today is evolving into a new paradigm that integrates intelligence, including perceptual, cognitive, and autonomous intelligence, into computing methods, architectures, and systems (Zhu et al., 2023).
- This form of computing optimizes existing methods according to the task needs and fosters new theories and architectures that go beyond traditional supercomputing or cloud paradigms.
- The aim is to provide efficient, secure, autonomous, and reliable computing services that support large-scale complex tasks, especially in the interconnected world of physical, digital, and human spaces. 
★ Classic academic views, such as Britannica's definition (Belford & Tucker, 2019), describe computing as the study of computers and their theoretical and practical applications, including algorithms, data structures, software and hardware design, and their use in processing information. 
The discipline also incorporates aspects of mathematics, electrical engineering, and management information systems, demonstrating its interdisciplinary nature. 
- Theoretical foundations include models like the Turing machine and the stored-program concept, which are fundamental to modern computing systems.
- Over time, computing has moved from purely scientific and corporate uses to a vast field impacting every sector of society.
</p><br>

    <h3>The Five Disciplines</h3><br>

    <h4>1. Computer Engineering (CpE)</h4>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="images/ce.png" alt="Computer Engineering">
        <p class="img-caption">Figure 4. Computer Engineering Focus</p>
    </div>

    <p>- Computer Engineering evolved from electrical engineering programs that had taught digital circuits and logic design, formalized as a discipline to address the need for computer hardware development and integration.
- Suitable for students who are mostly interested in hardware design. For example, students who want to design or build computers or computing devices. Also, for students interested in the type of programming which is embedded in these devices to control their behavior (Ramos-Torres , 2018).
- According to The Association for Computing Machinery (2005),  it is broad across the bottom because computer engineering covers the range from theory and principles to the practical application of designing and implementing products using hardware and software. It narrows towards the center as we move upwards because a computer engineer’s interests narrow as we move away from the hardware. By the time we get up to the level of software development, we see that the computer engineer’s interest has narrowed to the horizontal center because they care about software only as much as they need it to develop integrated devices.</p>
<br>
    <h4>2. Computer Science (CS)</h4>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="images/cs.png" alt="Computer Science Discipline">
        <p class="img-caption">Figure 5. Computer Science Focus</p>
    </div>

    <p>- Computer Science programs mostly originated from mathematics or engineering departments. 
- They focused on computer programming, algorithm development, computing theory, and related topics, with minimal emphasis on practical applications initially.
- Suitable for students who are highly interested in programming. Also, for students interested in research, as well as in the theoretical and formal aspects of computer software (Ramos-Torres , 2018).
- According to ACM (2005),  Computer science covers most of the vertical space between the extreme top and extreme bottom because computer scientists generally do not deal with just the hardware that runs software, or just the organization that makes use of the information that computing can provide. As a group, computer scientists care about almost everything in between those areas (down as far as the software that enables devices to work and up as far as the information systems that help organizations to operate). They design and develop all types of software from systems infrastructure (operating systems, communications programs, etc.) to application technologies (web browsers, databases, search engines, etc.) Computer scientists create these capabilities, but they do not manage the deployment of them. Therefore, the shaded area for computer science narrows and then stops as we move to the right. This is because computer scientists do not help people to select computing products, or tailor products to organizational needs, or learn to use such products.</p>
<br>
    <h4>3. Information Systems (IS)</h4>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="images/is.png" alt="Information Systems">
        <p class="img-caption">Figure 6. Information Systems Focus</p>
    </div>

    <p>- Information Systems programs typically emerged within business schools, particularly in accounting, addressing the practical application of computers in business processes such as information system design, operation, management, and accounting software.
- Suitable for students who are interested in procuring, implementing and supporting computing applications within an organizational context. In order to do so, students must be interested in obtaining a combination of both technical and functional (Accounting, Marketing, Strategic management, etc.) knowledge, which would enable them to act as a bridge between the more technical and the functional staff in organizations. IS students must also like to interact with people, besides interacting with technology (Ramos-Torres , 2018).
- According to ACM (2005), The shaded area extends across most of the top-most level because IS people are concerned with the relationship between information systems and the organizations that they serve, extending from theory and principles to application and development. Many IS professionals are also involved in system deployment and configuration and the training of users. The area covered by IS dips downward, all the way through software development and systems infrastructure in the right half of the graph. This is because IS specialists often tailor application technologies (especially databases) to the needs of the enterprise, and they often develop systems that utilize other software products to suit their organizations’ needs for information. (This figure does not reflect the attention that information systems programs devote to core business topics. See Chapter 3 for tables that summarize both computing and non-computing topics.)</p>
<br>
    <h4>4. Information Technology (IT)</h4>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="images/it.png" alt="Information Technology">
        <p class="img-caption">Figure 7. IT Focus</p>
    </div>

    <p>- It focuses on networked computing, management, and system deployment (perhaps just software systems, but perhaps also systems in support of learning, of information dissemination, and many others).
- Suitable for students who are highly interested in deploying and supporting the use of technology in organizations. (Implementing and operating servers, desktops, local area networks, wide area networks, and other components of the computing infrastructure in organizations requires more technical skills and less client- facing skills. But IT specialists also provide technical support to users of the computing infrastructure, in which case students must also like to interact with people, besides interacting with technology) (Ramos-Torres , 2018).
- According to ACM (2005), Its shaded area extends down most of the right edge as it focuses on the application, deployment, and configuration needs of organizations and people over a wide spectrum. Across this range (from organizational information systems, to application technologies and down to systems infrastructure), their role has some overlap with IS, but IT people have a special focus on satisfying human needs that arise from computing technology. In addition, the IT shaded area goes leftwards from application towards theory and innovation, especially in the area of application technologies. This is because IT people often develop the web-enabled digital technologies that organizations use for a broad mix of informational purposes, and this implies an appropriate conceptual foundation in relevant principles and theory. Because IT is a very new discipline, its focus has been on developing educational programs that give students a foundation in existing concepts and skills. Many in the community of IT faculty assert that research in their field will grow to create and develop new knowledge in relevant areas. When that happens, an appropriate snapshot would feature a shaded area that extends significantly further to the left. However, this is an ambition and not yet an achievement. This figure reflects the current status of IT. </p>
<br>
    <h4>5. Software Engineering (SE)</h4>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="images/se.png" alt="Software Engineering">
        <p class="img-caption">Figure 8. Software Engineering Focus</p>
    </div>

    <p>- Software Engineering arose from the need for more disciplined and rigorous software development methodologies. It addressed the challenges of creating reliable and complex software crucial for military, aerospace, telecommunications, and commercial applications.
- Suitable for students who are highly interested in designing and programming comprehensive and large-scale applications software, to be implemented in organizations or used by individuals. Also, for students interested in combining computing knowledge and techniques with engineering practices (Ramos-Torres , 2018).
- According to ACM (2005),  just as we have seen that computer engineering’s area spans the entire horizontal dimension at the lower hardware-related level, and IS spans most of that dimension at the higher organization-related level, software engineering covers a wide range with respect to the systematic development of software. This is because SE people fill a wide range of needs in large-project software expertise. SE’s main goal is to develop systematic models and reliable techniques for producing high-quality software on time and within budget, and these concerns extend all the way from theory and principles to daily practice. The domain of SE also extends downward through systems infrastructure since SE people develop software infrastructure that is robust in operation. Its domain also extends upward into organizational issues because SE people are interested in designing and developing information systems that are appropriate to the client organization.

    <h3>Analysis / Reaction</h3><br>

    <p>Computer science, as a rapidly evolving discipline, has profoundly influenced the world we live in today by combining theoretical foundations with practical technological developments. Studying its rich history and different computing disciplines demonstrates not just the field's sophisticated nature but also its profound impact on all aspects of modern society. As I researched about these topics, it dawned on me that computer science, as well as the other computing disciplines and majors, involves much more than merely being about “computers”.</p><br>
    <p>Computer science as a discipline delves more into theoretical foundations and algorithmic processes that serve as foundations to the wide variety of applications most of us use in modern society. As I delved deeper into how computer science as a discipline came to be, I discovered the specific remarkable minds behind its evolution. Initially, I only knew of Ada Lovelace as the world’s very first computer programmer—which became a significant inspiration to me—but then I found that there were other great minds that contributed to shaping computer science into what it is today, each adding unique insights that collectively formed the foundation of the field.</p><br>
    <p>Delving deeper into the different disciplines and majors of computing made me understand the differences of each discipline better as well as the common aspects all of them share. In a nutshell, CpE has a very strong emphasis on computer hardware while CS has a strong emphasis on algorithms & complexity, computer hardware, programming, and software life cycle. IS has a strong emphasis on developing information systems, and IT has emphases in human-computer interaction, information management (databases), development of information systems, networks, programming and security. SE has their major emphasis in the area of the software life cycle. All five programs, though, cover computer foundational topics, computer programming (including algorithms, implementation, and software quality) and more. In all fairness, tackling this topic was and will be helpful for students like me or future computing students to understand the right computing discipline to pursue.</p><br>
    <p>Computer science is a dynamic and foundational discipline that integrates theoretical principles with practical technological advancements, profoundly shaping modern society. Exploring its history as well as the 5 computing disciplines really proved that it is much more than just about computers; it is a multifaceted field that drives innovation across industries.</p><br>
